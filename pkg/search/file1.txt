Yeah! Oh! Get Up! I said get up! Let's go!
Better watch out (now)
'Cause here we come (come)
And we ain't stoppin' until
We see the mornin' sun (sun)
So give us room to do our thing
'Cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
So err'body come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone (one)
Now first of all I'm a boss
I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him
If you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not trash to kick over the gas can 1111
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps trash
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up, dance! trash
